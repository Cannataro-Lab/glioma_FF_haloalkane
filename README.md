The analysis may be reproduced by running `main_analysis.R`, which accesses several scripts within `/R` and data from `/input_data`. 


Before running the pipeline for the first time, you need to manually download the data described in `/input_data` (some data are hosted elsewhere and require sign-in to obtain, so we cannot host them here, but these data are freely available).
